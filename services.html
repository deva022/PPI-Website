The inherent features of holograms of depth, clarity, multi-colour imaging and high impact make it a unique medium and when fused with print options, they open up a wide variety of designing possibilities. Holograms are preferred for all branding applications that have to provide an interactive medium to the consumer to view variable images through flip-flop designs, or where it is important to address security concerns through speciality imaging. The popular hologram types include the dot matrix, 2D/3D, and 3D that are widely used for packaging and labelling options. Today, besides anti-duplication, holograms are popular for gift-wraps and promotional packs & labels for kids to provide eye-catching visual appeal. PPL is amongst select few companies worldwide that offer a complete Holographic Packaging and Labelling solution that is successfully integrated across entire consumer packaging portfolio comprising of Flexibles, Speciality Cartons and a variety of labelling options.
